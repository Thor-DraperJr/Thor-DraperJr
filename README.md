# 👋 Hi, I'm Thor Draper Jr.

I am a Sr. Security Solutions Engineer at Microsoft, specializing in Microsoft Sentinel, XDR, and Azure technologies within the Healthcare and Life Sciences (HLS) organization. My career path is unique: after serving in the National Guard, I built experience in sales, sales management, and entrepreneurship running a gym, before joining Microsoft in 2021 and pivoting fully into cybersecurity.

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Applied Cybersecurity from the SANS Technology Institute (2024), and I’m passionate about helping organizations strengthen their security posture through innovative Microsoft solutions.
